This repository contains Jupyter (Colab) notebooks for the complete data analysis pipeline of the BDM Project.
Each major analytic process—such as data trimming, column selection, sales trend analysis, forecasting, inventory turnover, and ABC segmentation—is implemented in separate Google Colab notebooks.

All code is provided in Colab .ipynb format.

Each Colab notebook corresponds to a distinct stage or analysis process, which is written in clearly separated code blocks and well-commented for easy understanding.

You can run, modify, and experiment with each module individually in Colab using the provided links.
